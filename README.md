# react_adventures
Simple repository to keep details and history of me messing around with React. Also used to document resources that I've found useful from time to time:

* [React starter kit](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html)
* [React tutorial (using React 0.14)](http://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react/)
