# react_adventures
Simple repository to keep details and history of me messing around with React. Also used to document resources that I've found useful from time to time.

## React Resources
* [React starter kit](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html)
* [React tutorial (using React 0.14)](http://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react/)

## General Resources
* [Bypassing Firefox Same Origin Policy (useful for testing locally while using CDN versions of files)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17088609/disable-firefox-same-origin-policy)
